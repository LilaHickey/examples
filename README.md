Scratch repo to host demos

Most of these notebooks will also be posted on my [Wakari
account](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/kpsfire/datetime_axis).

The one-off examples are generally crafted in response to questions,
but the longer ones are more open-ended and may see significant
revision as time goes on.

Feel free to fork, comment, or ask questions.
